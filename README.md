# spider

## Aim
* This is a spider which is used to crawl apple store. We only crawl app name, url, description, and try to estimate its rank.
* Now, only chinese apps are crawled because the start url we used. If you need other languages, try to find the start urls by yourself.
* Actually, there are some bugs in it, like, some apps can not be crawled. Maybe the reason is that all apps are loaded dynamically.I will try to fix them in the future.
* if you are interested in it, please fork. star or give me your prs.
## Thanks
